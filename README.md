# ParallelCA

This project is a parallelized Python program (based on the Python multiprocessing library) designed to run a simulation of a modified variant of Conway's Game of Life/Cellular Automata. In this variant, the rules governing how individual cells remain in or transition between alive/dead states are altered in order to produce more frequent change across the entire simulation - as opposed to the traditional rules of Conway's, which often result in large static regions with only small pockets of activity. 
The program divides the Cellular Automata calculations up into individual rows of the 2-dimensional cell matrix, and assigns these rows to separate processes/threads, the number of which is specified using an argument. As Cellular Automata is a trivially parallelizable problem, this allows for large speed-ups when running the program on multicore hardware. 
The program takes in three arguments: -i, which specifies the path to the input file representing the starting state of the cell matrix, -o, which specifies the path to the output file where the resulting matrix (after 100 steps/generations of cellular automata calculations) will be written to, and optionally -p, which specifies the number of parallel processes to divide the computation among (if left empty, this value defaults to 1, processing the entire simulation serially).
